Hello! I'm currently a senior studying Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I'm passionate about people and technology and the ways in which these areas overlap, and I'm currently seeking work in the fields of qualitative research, technical writing, or human-computer interactions. I am I am self-motivated, analytical, creative, and I'm seeking to learn as much as I can about the industries and fields I’m interested in.

Most of my coding experience is in Python, although I have some experience coding in C++ and HTML/CSS. I've also worked with a team to deploy surveys and conduct interviews and complete qualitative analysis based on the results. I enjoy collaboration with clients and camaraderie with teammates while solving business and technology problems, and I possess strong analytical skills while paying attention to detail.

I am able to work both independently on teams, and I am often able to discern which questions to ask in interviews based on my listening skills. I’m communicative and inclusive, seeking to express complex ideas clearly for an audience and keep everyone in the loop as we encounter setbacks or make progress. I care about the success of my customers and the people around me and seek to bring them together around what is possible.
