This project was a survey that I designed and deployed as part of a team. We surveyed a total of 57 student participants and asked a number of questions about respondentsâ€™ experiences using Buff Portal, an online platform for student resources. After compiling our data and performing thematic analysis on the responses, we presented our findings and proposed potential changes to the app based on student feedback.

Our research question was:

> Does Buff Portal provide a platform which properly aids students in finding solutions to their various school-related needs?

In other words, is Buff Portal very useful to students? We also asked contextual questions as part of our survey in order to gain a better understanding of why students did or did not think that Buff Portal does its job well.
