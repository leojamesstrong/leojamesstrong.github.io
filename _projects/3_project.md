This project features a prototype of an application UI conceptualized with the goal of addressing the lack of pulse sensing applications with a user-friendly visual interface that not only take and display the user’s pulse, but display that data in the context of that of a general populace, including a visible range of heart rates
that are generally considered to be healthy and how the user’s pulse fits into that range.
