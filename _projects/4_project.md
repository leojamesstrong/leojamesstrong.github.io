This project

<blockquote>How might we be able to represent people's different tastes in music in an easy to digest visual format?</blockquote>

<p>Our three forms of research meshed together very well in triangulation. Sunny focused on studying music and learning different styles and trends that have historically been associated with genres. Leo’s IDEO cards took this a step further by visualizing several of these traits and allowing us to gauge some of what works and what didn’t necessarily work as planned. Baker’s survey was useful when it came to learning about the audience and determining whether they even had any interest in owning non-fungible property. In the next phase, we focused more on the application of what we’ve learned.</p>

<p>From here, we had a clearer idea of our next steps. In terms of icons and accessories, we focused more on developing a large volume of ideas. While some of these ideas could be less useful, by producing as many as possible, we were able to find several that brought more clarity to the whole problem. An important finding we had was that while there are certain articles of clothing or accessories that can be genre-specific, some can span many tastes. One solution we decided on to overcome this was having some of the same icons but in different styles based on the genre. For example, neck chains have been popular in the music industry for a long time, but their styles vary greatly, with a country singer wearing a necklace with a cross or rapper Gucci Mane wearing a VVS Ice Cream chain. As this variation often signals a singer’s preferred genre, we could be creative by implementing similar differences in our own project.</p>
